# Personal Portfolio Website
This project entailed creating a website to act as my home on the web, with details about my experience, knowledge, and skills. I created this using a bootstrap 5 HTML template, and edited the files to be personalized, as well as adding in details to the page. 


# What Did I Learn?
I learned basic source code management using GitHub desktop. I also learned CSS coding and HTML5 coding. Within our website, I learned about meta tags, favicons, cookies, pop-ups, and analytical reporting.
